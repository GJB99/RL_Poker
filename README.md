Reinforcement Learning for Texas Hold'em Poker
Problem Definition
Our goal is to develop an AI agent capable of playing Texas Hold'em poker (specifically the No-Limit variant, as that's what's most common in casinos) at a high level of skill. Texas Hold'em is a challenging domain for AI due to:

Imperfect Information: Players have hidden information (their hole cards), making it impossible to know the exact state of the game.

Large State Space: The number of possible game states (combinations of hole cards, community cards, betting history, etc.) is enormous.

Continuous Action Space: In No-Limit Hold'em, players can bet any amount of chips (up to their stack size), creating a continuous action space that makes traditional Q-learning methods difficult to apply.

Stochasticity: The dealing of cards introduces randomness into the game.

Complex Strategies: Optimal poker play involves bluffing, deception, opponent modeling, and balancing bet sizes to maximize expected value.

Approach
We will use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train our poker AI agent. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Environment:

We'll use the RLCard library to provide a robust and well-tested Texas Hold'em environment. It handles game rules, player actions, and reward calculations.

Agent:

Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) will be our core RL algorithm. PPO is a policy gradient method that is known for its stability, sample efficiency, and ability to handle continuous action spaces. We will use Stable Baselines 3 to help us implement PPO.

Observation Space: The agent's observation will include:

The agent's hole cards

The community cards

Pot size

The agent's current stack

The opponent's current stack (if observable)

Betting history (actions taken in the current and previous rounds)

Action Space: We'll work with a discretized action space to make the problem more manageable:

Fold

Call

Raise: We'll define a set of possible raise sizes (e.g., 0.5x pot, 1x pot, 2x pot, all-in). This is a simplification, but it's a common approach in poker AI research.

Reward: The agent will receive a reward equal to the change in its chip stack at the end of each hand.

Neural Network:

Architecture: A feedforward neural network will be used to represent the agent's policy and value function.

Input Layer: Encodes the observation space (using one-hot encoding for cards and normalized values for numerical features).

Hidden Layers: 2-3 fully connected layers with ReLU activation.

Output Layer:

Policy Head: A softmax layer to output probabilities for the discrete actions (Fold, Call, Raise options).

Value Head: A single neuron to output the estimated value of the current state.

Training:

Self-Play: The agent will primarily be trained through self-play, where it plays against copies of itself. This allows the agent to learn by continually improving its strategy against its own past strategies.

Evaluation: We'll periodically evaluate the agent's performance by playing it against:

Random agents

Simple rule-based agents

Potentially other RL agents trained with different hyperparameters or architectures
